# Experimenting with webpack executing in the jvm

When I grow up, I want to be a webpack loader implemented on the JVM.
At this time, we are just proving the jvm can run webpack in j2v8. Even
though there is a small Clojure bit, I'd be fine with java in case that
helps.

## Usage

```
yarn install
lein webpack
```

If all goes well, you should end up with `dist/bundle.js`
